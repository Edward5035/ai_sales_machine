            Hi <span class="variable">[FIRST_NAME]</span>,<br><br>
            
            I hear this a lot: "I know I should take better care of my <span class="variable">[HEALTH_AREA]</span>, but I just don't have time for another appointment."<br><br>
            
            I completely understand. Between work, family, and everything else, adding one more thing to your schedule feels overwhelming.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Here's what I tell all my patients:</strong><br><br>
            
            The time you invest in your health today saves you countless hours (and dollars) later. Early prevention and treatment means:<br>
            • Fewer sick days and emergency visits<br>
            • More energy for the things you love<br>
            • Avoiding costly complications down the road<br><br>
            
            <strong>That's why we make it easy:</strong><br>
            • Flexible scheduling including evenings and weekends<br>
            • Efficient appointments that respect your time<br>
            • Same-day treatment when possible<br>
            • Minimal waiting room time<br><br>
            
            <strong>Plus, your initial consultation is complimentary.</strong> No financial commitment - just information to help you make the best decision for your health.<br><br>
            
            What's the real cost of waiting? Let's find out what's possible when you prioritize your wellness.<br><br>
