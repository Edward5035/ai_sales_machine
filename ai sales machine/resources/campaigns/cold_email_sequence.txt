Hi [First Name],

Hi [First Name],

Not sure if my last email reached you, but I wanted to share something that might be valuable.

I've been working with [industry] companies for [X] years, and I consistently see 3 costly mistakes:

1. [SPECIFIC MISTAKE #1 related to their likely challenges]
   - What it costs: [quantified impact]
   - Quick fix: [actionable tip]

2. [SPECIFIC MISTAKE #2 related to their likely challenges]  
   - What it costs: [quantified impact]
   - Quick fix: [actionable tip]

3. [SPECIFIC MISTAKE #3 related to their likely challenges]
   - What it costs: [quantified impact] 
   - Quick fix: [actionable tip]

These might not apply to [Company], but I thought they were worth sharing in case they're helpful.

Worth a 15-minute conversation?

[Your Name]

==== EMAIL 3: SOCIAL PROOF & CASE STUDY ====
SUBJECT: How [Similar Company] solved [relevant problem]
SEND: Day 7

Hi [First Name],

I wanted to share a quick story that might be relevant to [Company].

Last quarter, I worked with [Similar Company], a [industry] company similar to yours. They were struggling with [relevant problem that your prospect likely faces].

Here's what was happening:
- [Specific pain point #1]

- [Specific pain point #3]

We implemented a [solution approach] that resulted in:
✓ [Specific result #1 with numbers]
✓ [Specific result #2 with numbers]  
✓ [Specific result #3 with numbers]

The CEO told me it was "the best investment we made all year."

I'm not sure if [Company] is facing similar challenges, but if so, I'd be happy to share what worked.

Interested in a brief conversation about how this might apply to your situation?

Best regards,
[Your Name]

P.S. I can put you in touch with their CEO if you'd like to hear the story directly from him.

==== EMAIL 4: ADDRESSING THE SILENCE ====
SUBJECT: Did I miss the mark?
SEND: Day 10

Hi [First Name],

I've sent you a few emails about [relevant topic], but haven't heard back.

Did I miss the mark entirely?

I'm wondering if:
□ This isn't a priority right now
□ You're already working with someone on this
□ I'm reaching out to the wrong person
□ My timing is just off
□ Something else entirely

If it's just not a fit, no worries at all - just let me know and I'll stop reaching out.

But if the timing isn't right or you'd prefer to discuss this with someone else on your team, I'm happy to circle back later or connect with the right person.

Either way, I'd appreciate 30 seconds of your time just to know where things stand.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
